# GameMaker Cloud: Bugs
 
Please do report bugs here for problems you have found with GameMaker web-based services; however, before submitting anything, it is essential that you carefully read the rest of this page, so that you can be sure the issue is something you need to tell us about and is not reported already.

<br />

## 1. Search for any existing report before you send one - do not file a duplicate

Always search [the list of existing issues](/../../issues) and ensure your problem is not already reported, as responding to duplicates only slows us down. You can type your search terms into the query box at the top of the page.

If your issue is already reported you are welcome to add a comment/log/sample project onto that existing report - you can also leave a thumbs up to say you have this issue as well.

<br />

## 2. Choose the correct form and fill it all in

When [submitting a bug](/../../issues/new/choose), fill in each field with all pertinent information you can provide.

Send all requested information, otherwise there will be a delay while we request what's missing.
